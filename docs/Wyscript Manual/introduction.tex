\chapter{Introduction}
In fulfilment of the requirements of my Summer Research scholarship, I spent my summer working on the WyScript programming language. WyScript is a subset of the Whiley programming language, large enough to capture Whiley's general syntax, but without any of Whiley's additional features (such as enforced invariants). I added new language features to WyScript, debugged existing features, improved the compiler's error handling, and added support for the conversion of WyScript source code to JavaScript code.\\

This manual was created to provide a reference for the JavaScriptFileWriter (hereafter called the FileWriter) class inside the WyScript compiler, the class responsible for the WyScript to JavaScript conversion, so that the reader can better understand the processes by which the conversion takes place. In particular, it will cover the cases where the conversion was non-trivial - where there was no equivalent JavaScript code for a WyScript feature. This includes WyScript's type system, a handful of operators, and two control-flow structures.
